# Python: Jupyter Notebook & Pandas
Utilizing the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment and the powerful Pandas library, this repository showcases my journey of Python data analysis. I learned the basics of Python, explored real-world datasets, manipulated and visualized data, crafted data insights with Python's dynamic capabilities, and executed web scraping.
## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing with Pandas.
- Analyzing data using Pandas DataFrames.
- Crafting interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Presenting data insights with narrative-driven Jupyter Notebooks.
